# End-to-End AWS Cloud Engineering Project: VPC, EC2, RDS, IaC & Monitoring

##  Overview

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and managing AWS cloud infrastructure.
I built a secure and scalable environment using **VPC, EC2, RDS, IAM, CloudFormation, and CloudWatch**, simulating a real-world cloud engineering workflow.

The project highlights skills in:

* Cloud Infrastructure Deployment (VPC, EC2, RDS)
* Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)
* Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)
* Security (IAM, Security Groups, SSL/TLS)
* Automation & Cost Optimization

##  Project Steps

 1Ô∏è VPC & EC2 Deployment

* Created a **custom VPC** with public/private subnets, route tables, and NAT gateway.
* Launched EC2 instances in the public subnet for web servers.
* Configured security groups and IAM roles.

üì∑ Example:

2 RDS Database Setup

* Deployed a **MySQL RDS instance** inside private subnet.
* Configured parameter groups, subnet groups, and security groups.
* Ensured encryption and backups were enabled.

üì∑ Example:

3  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation

* Created **CloudFormation templates** to automate deployment of EC2, Security Groups, and VPC.
* Validated deployment and reviewed **stack events**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Logging

* Enabled **CloudWatch metrics and alarms** for EC2 and RDS.
* Configured **CloudTrail** to track API activity.
* Created **KPI dashboards** to visualize performance.

## üìä Key Learnings

* Gained practical experience in **building secure AWS infrastructure**.
* Learned how to apply **IaC for repeatable deployments**.
* Practiced **monitoring and cost-optimization techniques**.
* Strengthened knowledge of **VPC networking, RDS security, and IAM principles**.

## üöÄ Next Steps

* Add **Terraform** templates for multi-cloud comparison.
* Deploy a containerized app using **ECS/EKS**.
* Integrate with **CI/CD pipeline (CodePipeline/CodeBuild)**.
